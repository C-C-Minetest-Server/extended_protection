# Extended Protection

**This mod does not contain any protection policies. Write your policies in the form of mods.**

This mod provides extended control over player interaction, i.e. node placement and destruction.

The API is similar to the built-in `minetest.is_protected` and related functions, see `src/item_place_node.lua` and `src/node_dig.lua` for more information.
